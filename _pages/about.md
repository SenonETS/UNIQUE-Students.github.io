### Territorial acknowledgement

We acknowledge that the lands and waters where most of us live and where our universities are located---[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/indigenouspeoples/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/circ/land-acknowledgement) and [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html)---are the traditional and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples. The Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) Nation call Tiohtiá:ke the site commonly known as Montréal. Since long before the arrival of European settlers, this territory has been and continues to be a gathering place for many Indigenous peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within our communities.
