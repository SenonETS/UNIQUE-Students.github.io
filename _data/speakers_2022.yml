  bio: Courtney Paquette is an assistant professor at McGill University and a CIFAR Canada AI chair, MILA. Paquette’s research broadly focuses on designing and analyzing algorithms for large-scale optimization problems, motivated by applications in data science. She received her PhD from the mathematics department at the University of Washington (2017), held postdoctoral positions at Lehigh University (2017-2018) and University of Waterloo (NSF postdoctoral fellowship, 2018-2019), and was a research scientist at Google Research, Brain Montreal (2019-2020).

  title: "Optimization Algorithms in the Large: Exact Dynamics, Average-case Analysis, and Stepsize Criticality"
  abstract: In this talk, I will present a framework, inspired by random matrix theory, for analyzing the dynamics of optimization algorithms (e.g., 1st-order methods, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and momentum) when both the number of samples and dimensions are large. Using this new framework, we show that the dynamics of optimization algorithms on a least squares problem with random data become deterministic in the large sample and dimensional limit. In particular, the limiting dynamics for stochastic algorithms are governed by a Volterra integral equation. This model predicts that SGD undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly given critical stepsize that ultimately affects its convergence rate, which we also verify experimentally. Finally, when input data is isotropic, we provide explicit expressions for the dynamics and average-case convergence rates. These rates show significant improvement over the worst-case complexities.

  position: Lecturer
  bio: "I studied electrical engineering and computer science at Supélec (France), and a Masters in theoretical neuroscience in Edinburgh (UK). I then spent several happy years as a PhD student in Wulfram Gerstner's lab at EPFL (Switzerland), and yet happier years as a postdoc with Máté Lengyel's in Cambridge (UK). By a twist of fate which the best scientists can't explain, I was later offered to stay as faculty in the Computational and Biological Learning lab (Engineering Department, University of Cambridge). My group is broadly interested in the principles that govern the plasticity and dynamics of cortical networks, and their role in probabilistic computations such as perception and motor control.  We maintain an active interest in machine learning, both in developing new tools for the analysis of neural data, but also in studying deep networks, their optimization, and what they might tell us about the brain."

  title: "V1 be one: unifying phenomenology and function in a network model of cortical variability"
  abstract: "Cortical responses to visual stimuli have a rich phenomenology, with well-documented nonlinearities, transients, oscillations, and stimulus-dependent patterns of across-trial variability. What principles of network dynamics underlie these features, and what function(s) do they serve? I will present our recent efforts to address these questions and unify previously disparate bottom-up and top-down models of V1. First, I will show that several key properties of V1 responses are difficult to reconcile with the classical theory of tightly balanced E/I networks; on the contrary, a regime of loose E/I balance accomodates these properties robustly (Hennequin et al., Neuron (2018)). Second, building up on this, I will show that yet more properties of V1 dynamics emerge in a loosely-balanced network model trained to perform sampling-based Bayesian inference (Echeveste et al., Nat. Neurosci. (2020))."

  title: "Maintenance of neuronal states powered by the self-organization"
  abstract: "It is widely believed that some neuronal states are better suited for computations than others. For example, closeness to the critical state at the second-order phase transition was shown to be particularly suitable for computations in artificial systems. Alternatively, the balance of excitation and inhibition was also associated, i.e., with optimized information encoding. But, in the everchanging and dynamic neuronal populations, how can these states be reached and maintained? I believe the only possible solution is to harness the mechanisms of self-organization. In my talk, I will show examples of self-organization to particular states from neuronal data and propose how synaptic plasticity and adaptation can help maintain them."
